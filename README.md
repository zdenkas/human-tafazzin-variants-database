Human Tafazzin Variants Database modifications.

This repository contains Python notebooks that fix inconsistencies in the Human Tafazzin Variants Database and enhance the database with publicly available data.

The official version of the Human Tafazzin Variants Database is currently available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O2MKa5FHsvq3hyjOVSsOZf37xkwKYAJ8 

Folders:
* notebooks:
    * Python notebooks that were applied to the dataset in alphanumerical order (e.g., notebook 0000_xxx.ipynb was applied first, 0001_yyy.ipynb after that, â€¦).
    * Each notebook contains code that generated a new version of the database.
    * Notebooks also serve as database versioning documentation: at the beginning of each notebook, you will find a description of what changes for that particular version.
* database_versions:
    * Versions of the database. They contain a timestamp in their name and can be matched to corresponding notebooks with the number before the underscore. (E.g., notebook 0000_xxx.ipynb generated database (excel file) 0000_some-timestamp_Human-TAFAZZIN-Variants-Database.xlsx.)
    * The latest version is the one with the highest number..
