# Dataset cleaning:
-------------------
- fix 2-55 reference
-----
- for Location, sometimes there is space in the beginning, etc --- should be unified (compare with alphasense dataset where we have one column for chromosome and one for position)
- for Location, it is not clear what data after - and _ mean, and also there is sometimes space, sometimes not...
----
- Protein Variant Type column should be also in benign. it is almost impossible to just parse all missense variants from benign sheet
----
- DNA modifications column is very difficult to parse. (E.g. compare with alpha missense dataset where we have just REF ALT)
-> at least we should strip values, e.g. c.589G>A is sometimes with space, sometimes without, then we can't match it..

---
row 36 vs 35: same location hg38, other hg37 --- check this automatically in all places
----
cases when pathogenic mutations are not in Alpha missense --- are these mistakes in Tafazzin database?
----
empty rows in benign sheet for hg38, e.g. 63/64
---
empty column in pathogenic sheet
---
better parsing of some columns:
'PolyPhen2 prediction', # column not in df_pathogenic, but this info can be extracted from 'Method of Validation'
'SIFT prediction', # column not in df_pathogenic, but this info can be extracted from 'Method of Validation'
'Protein Variant Type', # only in df_pathogenic, should be added also to other sheets
'References', # only in df_pathogenic, should be made consistent with other sheets, where similar column contains population frequency, see below
'References & population frequency'] # not in df_pathogenic, see above
'Splicing Prediction' # TODO why is this column not in pathogenic and vus?

# Dataset enhancements:
-----------------------
Reclassification with ACMG
-------------------------
Add new publicly available data
E.g. from Gnomad, TODO
----
Add clinical data accessible in papers
E.g. [this paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30226969/) contains clinical info and can be directly linked to the database
---
Add scores/info from new methods, such as Alpha Missense, Alphafold?
---
?? Find & add whole genomes
- Public
- Ask BSF
